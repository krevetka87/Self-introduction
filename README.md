# Self-introduction
Hello!
My name is Anastasia. I am from Moscow and I am thirty-five years old.
I have worked in auto insurance for more than thirteen years,
but in 2021 i decided to change my job and start learning web development. 
I chose this direction as the most promising and interesting for myself.
After a long study of various courses, I chose the Free Front-end course from The Rolling Scopes community.
Three months later I was forced to leave the course due to lack of free time, but in June 2022 I returned to it.

I want to talk about one of the projects from the zero stage of this course.
This application is called Momentum. This is an analogue of the application from Google. 
This was the first project that was quite difficult for me.
Application includes an audio player, weather widget, to-do list, quote collection, application customization options, the ability to translate into two languages and change the background image.
In this project I used HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies.
I learned how to save and retrieve data from localstorage, how to work with Date and Audio objects and JSON files, how to display data on a page and dynamically add elements to the page.
Also, when I was working on this application, I got the opportunity to study the Weather and Image API, and learned to work with async requests.
The most difficult part of this work for me was the audio player. I had to watch several YouTube videos to understand how it works and completely rewrite the code several times. It took me three or four days to write the code for the player. It was very difficult for me, like the rest of the application, but it helped me a lot in my other projects.

Now I am completing the first stage of this course and I hope to successfully pass the interview with the mentor. I would like to wish all students success in their studies and future careers. Thank you for watching my video! Good bye!
